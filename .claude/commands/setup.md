# /setup — Claude Code adapter

Before delegating, disclose that Claude Code auto-memory is enabled by default
and may write machine-local memory automatically during ordinary sessions. The
user can inspect it with `/memory` or disable it with
`autoMemoryEnabled: false` in `.claude/settings.local.json`. This repository's
review gates govern its own lifecycle and `/dream` flows; they do not turn
ordinary host auto-memory into a reviewed write path. Do not change the setting
as part of setup.

Read and follow `.agents/skills/context-setup/SKILL.md` as the canonical workflow.

After the user approves the portable workflow's proposed changes:

- replace the `[Your Name]` placeholder in `CLAUDE.md` when a name was supplied and the placeholder still exists;
- if the user wants a Claude Code slash command for a newly approved portable skill, create only a thin adapter in `.claude/commands/` and add its row to the table in `CLAUDE.md`; and
- offer, but never assume, a commit after showing the final diff and validation result.

Finish by mapping the portable lifecycle back to Claude Code: `/start` begins a session and `/end` closes it.
