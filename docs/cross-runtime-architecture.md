# Cross-runtime architecture

Context OS guarantees equivalent lifecycle state transitions across supported
runtimes. It does not claim identical command syntax, hook timing, permission
models, tool names, or native memory.

The [root contract](root-contract.md) defines product assets (`KernelRoot`),
durable lifecycle state (`ContextRoot`), and the nominal application working
directory (`WorkingRoot`). v0.12 colocates them on its normal full-template
wrapper path. A marker-only root may use already-loaded code for discovery,
reports, diagnosis, direct provider-neutral hooks, and proposal publication,
but named runtime execution and mutation require the colocated trusted product
closure. Verified detached-bundle materialization is the separate bootstrap boundary.
External project attachment uses exact distinct roots, a portable tracked Git
identity, and an ignored machine-local binding. Claude and Codex use that same
kernel contract while WorkingRoot remains read-only lifecycle evidence.

## Layers

1. **Repository state:** `identity/`, `projects/`, `state/`, and `sessions/` are
   the durable, reviewable source of truth.
2. **Portable intent:** `.agents/skills/context-*` gathers facts and asks for
   judgment without owning mutation mechanics.
3. **Deterministic kernel:** `bash scripts/contextos.sh` owns paths, rendering,
   invariants, proposals, locks, optimistic hashes, applies, and receipts.
4. **Component inventory:** `components/manifest.json` assigns every tracked
   product, seed, and development path to one owner and defines the dependency
   closure shared by runtime selections. It is validated metadata, not a file
   materializer. See [the component model](component-model.md).
5. **Runtime adapters:** discoverable schema-v2 descriptors in `runtimes/` map
   each host surface to instructions, skills, lifecycle invocations, probes,
   capabilities, and evidence. Provider files remain in their adapter directories.
6. **Conformance:** dependency-light tests assert exact state transitions;
   opt-in launch tests exercise installed host discovery without hiding skips.

The [ACP connection foundation](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/agent-context-os/blob/1d5f0dfa590cfd189128169d1aace00526442993/adapters/acp/README.md) prepares shared message
handling for Cursor and Hermes app clients. Its synthetic protocol tests do not
establish installed-runtime support. ACP connection mode, desktop IDE behavior,
and ordinary CLI behavior require separate evidence even when they use the same
portable skills and kernel.

## Commands

```text
bash scripts/contextos.sh start [--now ISO_TIMESTAMP]
bash scripts/contextos.sh propose setup|update|end --input payload.json [--now ISO_TIMESTAMP]
bash scripts/contextos.sh apply proposal.json --confirm SHA256 --runtime RUNTIME
bash scripts/contextos.sh install --runtime RUNTIME
bash scripts/contextos.sh doctor [--runtime RUNTIME | --all]
```

`--now` exists for deterministic fixtures. Production calls use local time.

## Input contracts

Update requires `progress: [string]` and optionally accepts complete
`current_markdown`. End requires `what_happened: [string]` and accepts
`decisions`, `next_time`, and complete desired Markdown for state files that
materially changed. Setup accepts `files: {path: content}` and requires every
populated replacement path in `replace_populated`.

The kernel rejects absolute paths, traversal, setup writes outside approved
context paths beneath the v0.12 ContextRoot, multiple or missing `Last Updated`
lines, and no-op proposals.

## Transaction protocols

Proposal files contain exact after-content, unified diffs, and before/after
SHA-256 values. Their proposal digest covers the entire unsigned proposal. It
binds integrity; the host permission prompt supplies the human approval boundary.
Apply requires that exact digest, re-hashes every target, takes an exclusive
`O_EXCL` lock, writes using UTF-8/LF, and emits a receipt inside a durable,
path-bound journal. The journal gives `setup`, `update`, `end`, `promotion`, and
`agent-config` resumable rollback across process death. Promotion additionally
binds its coordination source and canonical target into the journal and receipt,
so recovery validates the same provenance as apply. New tracked content is
non-executable; existing targets preserve their approved mode.

The `agent-config` workspace-migration workflow additionally binds raw-byte
target and source hashes, proposal-bound before/after modes,
workflow-specific ownership, and write/delete authorization. After an
interrupted apply, an operator first confirms no apply process is active and
removes the stale lock; the next approved proposal apply restores the
journaled state before revalidation. `doctor` surfaces both artifacts and never
deletes them silently. A valid committed receipt does not retire its journal
until every target still matches its receipt-bound bytes and mode.
POSIX mode bits are enforced exactly; Windows enforces its meaningful
writable/read-only boundary without claiming POSIX fidelity. This stronger
boundary currently owns only `contextos.workspace.json` and migration-only
deletion of `workspace.yaml`; it is not a generic component file writer.

Proposals and receipts can contain full state text. They remain local and ignored
by Git; `doctor` warns when artifacts are older than 30 days so the owner can
remove them after their audit or recovery value has expired.

The kernel never commits, pushes, calls an integration, or accesses native
memory. Those actions remain separate approval boundaries.

## Capabilities and degradation

`runtimes/*.json` declares capabilities per host surface as `native`, `adapter`,
`advisory`, or `unsupported`. `contextos/runtime_schema.py` is the authoritative
contract and deterministically generates `runtimes/schema.json`; validation
fails if the generated schema or README support table drifts. `generic` is a
reserved apply-receipt identity, never a discoverable or installable runtime.
Adapters may improve presentation or catch errors earlier, but unsupported hooks
never weaken kernel enforcement. Hermes copied skills can drift, so installation
and `doctor` report that boundary explicitly.

Tracked runtime intent lives in `contextos.workspace.json`; local availability
and configured manifest digests live in `.context-os/hosts.json`. Neither local
binary detection nor an operation receipt can add or remove the tracked set.
See [workspace configuration and migration](workspace-configuration.md).

Binary probes are declarative, resolution-only checks. `doctor` may resolve the
listed executable candidates with `PATH`, but runtime descriptors cannot supply
arguments or cause a process to execute. Native diagnostic execution requires a
separate code-owned trust policy.

Bare `doctor` follows tracked `agents` when `contextos.workspace.json` exists.
Shipped but unselected adapters remain visible as inert and cannot make that
profile fail. Without tracked JSON, the legacy compatibility scope remains: one
locally onboarded host narrows the check, while zero or multiple hosts inspect
the registry. `doctor --runtime ID` explicitly inspects one runtime and
`doctor --all` applies the strict maintainer scope to every shipped descriptor.

The report keeps separate facts separate: declared support, selected-component
materialization, customization (not verifiable until immutable bundle hashes
exist), local executable availability, local onboarding, descriptor drift,
declared conformance, and evidence freshness. A missing binary is unavailable,
not unsupported. Declared conformance is not reported as executed, and binary
resolution never launches the candidate.

## Conformance policy

Every lifecycle mutation needs:

- a successful transition test;
- an exact-confirmation rejection;
- a stale-target rejection;
- a concurrent-lock rejection;
- path-containment controls; and
- a must-not-change assertion for unrelated files.

Runtime launch tests are opt-in because CI may not have installed clients or
authentication. A skip is visible and is not counted as evidence of parity.
