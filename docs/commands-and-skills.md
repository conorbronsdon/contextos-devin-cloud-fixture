# Commands and skills

Context OS guarantees shared state transitions, not identical host features.
Portable skills gather and review intent; the deterministic kernel owns paths,
dates, append behavior, optimistic hashes, locking, and receipts.

## Shared lifecycle

| Job | Claude Code | Codex | Hermes | OpenClaw | Cursor CLI / Cursor IDE (experimental) | Devin CLI / session (experimental) | Deterministic operation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Initialize context | `/setup` | `$setup` | `/context-setup` | `/contextos <alias> setup` | `/context-setup` | `/context-setup` / `@skills:context-setup` | `contextos propose setup` then `apply` |
| Start a session | `/start` | `$start` | `/context-start` | `/contextos <alias> start` | `/context-start` | `/context-start` / `@skills:context-start` | read-only `contextos start` |
| Checkpoint | `/update` | `$update` | `/context-update` | `/contextos <alias> update` | `/context-update` | `/context-update` / `@skills:context-update` | `contextos propose update` then `apply` |
| Close a session | `/end` | `$end` | `/context-end` | `/contextos <alias> end` | `/context-end` | `/context-end` / `@skills:context-end` | `contextos propose end` then `apply` |

The portable cores are `.agents/skills/context-setup`, `context-start`,
`context-update`, and `context-end`. Short skill directories are thin aliases;
Claude files are host adapters. All lifecycle names require explicit invocation.
OpenClaw resumes setup, update, and end questions with
`/contextos <alias> continue <session-key> <response>` (or the operator-scoped
`contextos.continue` Gateway method). Its plugin does not expose apply; after
independent proposal review, an operator runs the kernel from a trusted shell.
Devin's portable skill frontmatter carries a native user-only trigger. Devin CLI
is first-class with versioned live evidence and avoids the short aliases because
it owns built-in `/update`; cloud sessions remain experimental until their
account-managed behavior has versioned live-conformance evidence.

The mutation protocol is always:

1. the agent drafts reviewed JSON input under ignored `.context-os/inputs/`;
2. `bash scripts/contextos.sh propose` emits exact diffs and a proposal digest;
3. the agent presents those diffs and waits;
4. `bash scripts/contextos.sh apply` receives that exact digest; and
5. the kernel verifies target hashes, takes an exclusive lock, writes only the
   proposal paths, and records a receipt.

## Runtime boundary

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex | Hermes | OpenClaw | Cursor CLI / Cursor IDE (experimental) | Devin CLI / session (experimental) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | `AGENTS.md` | `AGENTS.md` | Alias-bound execution-directory `AGENTS.md` | Root `AGENTS.md` | Root `AGENTS.md` |
| Portable skill source | Thin slash adapters | `.agents/skills/` | External directory or copied skills | Copied into private workspace `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/skills/` |
| Project hooks | `.claude/settings.json` | `.codex/hooks.json` after trust | Optional shell/plugin adapter | Not claimed | Not claimed | CLI `.devin/hooks.v1.json`; session not claimed |
| Authorization | Host settings | Host settings | Outside contract | Operator-scoped lifecycle plugin, OpenClaw model-tool policy, and separate trusted-shell apply | IDE/CLI permissions; CLI `--force` | CLI Normal-mode prompts (project rules limited); cloud account-managed |
| Lifecycle enforcement | Kernel | Kernel | Kernel | Kernel | Kernel | Kernel |
| Native memory | Claude auto-memory | Not part of the shared contract | `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` | Private OpenClaw workspace | Outside contract | Outside contract; cloud Knowledge is not synchronized |

Runtime manifests in `runtimes/` are machine-readable claims. Hooks are defense
in depth: the kernel repeats mutation invariants during every proposal and apply.

Run `bash scripts/contextos.sh capabilities --agent codex,hermes` to compare
explicitly named agents. Repeated `--agent` flags also work; omit them to use
the agents selected in `contextos.workspace.json`. Add `--json` for structured data.
The view lists each surface's support tier and capability values, portable skills
from component ownership, common skills, and differences. `unsupported` means the
descriptor does not claim the capability. `host-provided` marks native and
advisory capabilities, which do not depend on repository components. Adapter
capabilities list their runtime-specific required components in JSON and text.
`installed` means those components appear in `installed-bundle.json`;
`not-installed` means at least one is absent. `unknown-install-state` means
the file is absent. Skill install status uses each skill's owning component.
Availability is not permission or activation, and this view does not verify a
host installation.

## Portable skill index

| Skill | Job | Effects |
|---|---|---|
| `$context-setup` | Canonical setup core | Proposal/apply only |
| `$context-start` | Canonical read-only start core | No writes |
| `$context-update` | Canonical checkpoint core | Proposal/apply only |
| `$context-end` | Canonical close core | Proposal/apply only |
| `$migrate-gemini` | Map selected Gemini configuration | Reviewed mapping only |
| `$mine-gemini-workflows` | Recover repeated Gemini workflows | Narrow selected evidence |

The `$setup`, `$start`, `$update`, and `$end` rows in the shared lifecycle table
are the short portable aliases. The ten tokens above and in that table are the
complete shipped portable skill catalog.

The two migration skills do not expose private reasoning or make bulk-history
import safe. Their Claude adapters appear in the command index below.

## Claude-specific command index

| Command | Job | Effects and prerequisites |
|---|---|---|
| `/today` | Morning heartbeat | Reviewed heartbeat write; live data stays opt-in |
| `/capture` | Triage inbox notes | Approved destinations only; source cleanup remains separate |
| `/find-context` | Locate relevant context | Read-only |
| `/reconcile` | Detect repository drift | Read-only report unless fixes are separately approved |
| `/recover` | Inspect stale worktrees and branches | Read-only until destructive cleanup approval |
| `/content-shipped` | Log confirmed published content | Local content-log write; does not publish |
| `/clean-ai-writing` | Apply the writing workflow | Proposed revision only |
| `/dream` | Curate host-local auto-memory | Proposal artifacts only |
| `/dream-apply` | Apply reviewed memory proposals | Host-local write with per-item review |
| `/migrate-gemini` | Claude adapter for selected migration | Routes to the portable skill |
| `/mine-gemini-workflows` | Claude adapter for workflow recovery | Routes to the portable skill |

Uploading these files to claude.ai does not activate commands, hooks, tool
permissions, or skill metadata. See `docs/claude-projects-sync.md`.

### Published adapter provenance

Some Claude adapter files carry optional `x-source` and `x-source-version`
frontmatter. A `maintainer-core/...` value is a stable logical synchronization
ID, not a repository path or public link. It says that the public adapter was
reviewed and published from the maintainer's generic command core. The paired
hexadecimal version is the synchronization checkpoint used to detect lag; it
is provenance metadata, not a release tag or a claim that readers can fetch a
private source revision.

The checked-in adapter is the complete public artifact for that release.
Operative rules must be present in the file itself, and any separately
published upstream is linked directly in the file body at a pinned public
revision. Current adapter metadata and operative documentation never name
private repositories or private issue IDs; historical changelog entries remain
an audit record.
Removing these fields is safe for runtime discovery but discards useful
maintainer drift evidence; changing their logical IDs requires updating the
publication mapping as well.

Run `bash scripts/contextos.sh doctor` for runtime and state diagnostics, then
`bash scripts/validate-all.sh --workspace` after personalized repository
changes. Product contributors use the strict form without `--workspace`.
