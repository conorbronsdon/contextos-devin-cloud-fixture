# Choose an optional integration

Integrations are opt-in extensions, not part of the core session loop. This is
a curated task chooser, not an exhaustive inventory. Start with a concrete
outcome, choose at most one new trust boundary at a time, and read its full
generated entry in [`references/integrations.md`](../references/integrations.md).

Nothing in this guide installs, activates, authenticates, or grants permissions to an integration.

## Host compatibility evidence

Optional integration support is declared per integration and per host, separately
from the core adapter's runtime tier. The [OpenClaw adapter](../adapters/openclaw/README.md)
supports the Context OS lifecycle; it does not establish that any optional
integration works through OpenClaw. Generic MCP transport support never implies
support for a particular host.

An integration-by-host evidence record must state the tested host surface and
exact version, test date, credential model and storage location, network egress
destinations, and all reachable side effects, marking writes and destructive
actions. It must record the confirmation gates observed on that host, the
health-check command and observed output shape, verified uninstall and credential
revocation steps, and the location of the test evidence. Keep credentials and
private data out of that record.

The catalog schema now expresses per-host evidence in `host_evidence`. An entry
that lists `openclaw` in `supported_agents` must include a matching record with
the fields above and a repository evidence path. MarkItDown MCP
is the first entry with a documented OpenClaw test (CLI commands and one headless local-file turn), with the [OpenClaw test record](evidence/openclaw-markitdown-2026-09-26/README.md).
No confirmation event appears in its retained headless agent result, so the operator must
confirm the exact URI before each conversion. The [integration proposal](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/integration-proposal.md)
lists the host-evidence fields for future entries. The core adapter's runtime
tier remains separate from integration support, and generic MCP support never
implies support on a named host.

The obsolete checked-in `gws mcp` configuration was removed. The current Google Workspace path uses the reviewed CLI setup in [`references/google-workspace-cli-setup.md`](../references/google-workspace-cli-setup.md); it is still opt-in and is not pre-approved by the command adapters.

## Activation checklist

For the selected entry:

1. Read its current source and every linked evidence page.
2. Confirm the supported host and whether installation is project- or user-scoped.
3. List the exact credentials, local paths, accounts, vaults, or workspaces it can reach.
4. Start with the least privilege and the narrowest read-only health check available.
5. Require a separate confirmation for sensitive reads, writes, remote writes, publish, overwrite, deletion, arbitrary execution, OAuth, or destructive actions when the catalog marks them.
6. Record how to disable or uninstall it before relying on it.
7. Re-run `bash scripts/validate-all.sh --workspace` after changing tracked
   configuration.

Do not infer safety from the word `verified`. In this repository it means the catalog metadata was checked against linked evidence on the stated date; it is not live authentication, an end-to-end test, or a guarantee about future upstream behavior.

## When no integration is the right choice

Keep the core filesystem workflow when a tool would duplicate data, widen access without a concrete task, require more credentials than the outcome warrants, or add a remote write where a local file is enough. Repository context, lifecycle skills, and manual links remain useful without any optional integration.
