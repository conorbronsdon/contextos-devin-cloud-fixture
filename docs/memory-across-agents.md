# Memory across agents

Context OS is a Git-backed context layer, not a native-memory synchronizer.

| Concern | Canonical home |
|---|---|
| Facts every configured agent should see | Reviewed repository files |
| One host's private scratch or learned preferences | That host's native memory |
| Promotion from a session into shared state | Kernel proposal/apply transaction |
| Evidence of a host-confirmed shared mutation | Gitignored proposal and receipt |

## Claude Code

Claude auto-memory is machine-local and may write during ordinary sessions. Use
Claude's `/memory` command to inspect the active store; do not derive its path.
`/dream` and `/dream-apply` are separate review workflows for that host-local
store. They do not replace lifecycle proposal/apply for repository state.

## Codex

No Codex-native memory behavior is part of the shared contract. `AGENTS.md`,
`state/`, and `sessions/` provide continuity. Personal Codex configuration and
credentials remain outside the repository.

## Hermes Agent

Hermes `MEMORY.md` and `USER.md` are bounded, per-profile, machine-local memory.
Its Curator maintains Hermes-owned stores. Context OS never reads, writes, or
synchronizes those files automatically.

Use Hermes memory for host-local preferences and environment facts. Promote a
fact that must travel across runtimes only by drafting it into an approved
repository proposal. Do not run multiple writers against one Hermes home, and
do not duplicate the same fact in native memory and repository state without a
declared canonical home.

## OpenCode

Context OS claims no OpenCode-native memory surface. OpenCode session history,
provider state, and machine-local configuration remain outside the shared
contract and are not synchronized. `AGENTS.md`, `state/`, `sessions/`, and
kernel receipts provide portable continuity. Promote any durable fact only
through a reviewed proposal; see `adapters/opencode/README.md` for the model
data boundary.

## OpenClaw

OpenClaw's workspace is private memory, not a sandbox. Keep its `SOUL.md`,
`USER.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `memory/` directory in a private workspace outside
this repository. Configure the adapter plugin's project alias to the repository
root so plugin-owned lifecycle subagents receive its `AGENTS.md`, but do not
make the repository itself the OpenClaw workspace.

The first-class adapter copies lifecycle skills into that private workspace and
uses lightweight plugin-owned subagent sessions to bind multi-turn lifecycle
execution to the configured repository. Its lifecycle prompt forbids importing
private workspace memory into those sessions. It does not synchronize native
memory into Context OS. Promote a durable fact across runtimes only through the
same independently reviewed repository proposal used by the other hosts, then
apply it from a trusted shell outside the plugin.

## Cursor

Cursor rules and skills are prompt context, not shared memory. Cursor account
settings, IDE and CLI session history, Cloud Agents, Automations, and any
host-native memories stay outside the repository contract. Context OS does not
claim a foreground native-memory format or synchronize Cursor state.

Use `state/` and `sessions/` for continuity that must travel between runtimes.
Promote any durable Cursor-derived fact only through a reviewed repository
proposal. See `adapters/cursor/README.md` for the separate IDE and CLI boundary.

## Devin

Devin CLI has no native memory store beyond resumable session history, which
stays outside the shared contract. Devin Knowledge, Blueprint knowledge,
snapshots, and cloud session history are account-managed state, not repository
memory. Context OS neither materializes
nor synchronizes them. Durable cross-runtime facts still belong in `state/`,
`sessions/`, or another canonical repository file through a reviewed proposal.
See `adapters/devin/README.md` for the separate CLI, session, and Review boundaries.

## Proposal/apply boundary

All registered runtimes use the same repository transaction:

1. reviewed structured input;
2. exact proposed diffs and digest;
3. host-mediated explicit confirmation (the kernel does not authenticate the human);
4. optimistic hash and exclusive-lock checks;
5. bounded writes; and
6. a receipt naming the runtime and before/after hashes.

This provides portable provenance without copying private native memory between
providers. Proposal and receipt files are ignored and may still contain
sensitive context; treat the local checkout as part of the privacy boundary.
