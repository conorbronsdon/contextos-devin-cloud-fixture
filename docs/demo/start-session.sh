# docs/assets/start-demo.gif via docs/start-demo.tape.
#
# This reads no state files and calls no model. The numbers and the briefing
# below are the sample data from the example musician project that ships in
# this repo, and they match the transcript quoted in the README under
# "See it work". If you change one, change the other.
#
# Regenerate the GIF with:
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/vhs" ghcr.io/charmbracelet/vhs docs/start-demo.tape
