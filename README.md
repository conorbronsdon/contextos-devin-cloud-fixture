</div>

Chat history, project instructions, and copied prompts drift apart. Context OS is a Git-backed context and workflow layer that keeps the durable parts in plain Markdown: who you are, what you are working on, decisions already made, and the workflows you want an agent to follow.

Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor CLI, Devin CLI, and Hermes Agent have
first-class adapters. Cursor IDE and Devin cloud sessions remain experimental; their available
surfaces and evidence limits are listed in [host support](#host-support). These
adapters route to shared repository state, with a deterministic lifecycle kernel
that turns reviewed setup, checkpoint, and close requests into hash-checked
proposals and receipts. Host-native memory stays separate.

| What you need | How Context OS handles it |
|---|---|
| Bring useful context forward | A source-neutral [migration workflow](docs/migration-guide.md) turns selected chats, project instructions, memory exports, and documents into reviewable files. |
| Work across coding agents | Provider-neutral state, skills, and lifecycle transitions live outside host adapters. Registered runtimes share the same kernel. |
| Add the tools that fit | A generated [integration catalog](references/integrations.md) documents install scope, data access, side effects, and confirmation gates. Nothing is enabled automatically. |
| Keep context useful | Session handoffs, staleness checks, decision logs, and reviewable memory proposals make maintenance part of the normal workflow. |

Context OS does not scrape every account, sync product UIs automatically, or install integrations on setup. Imports are selective, browser-project sync is manual, and external capabilities remain opt-in.

## Experimental starter for one project

For a small project, try keeping the objective, decisions, and latest handoff
in one instruction file. If separate notes help you review that context, the
[experimental three-file starter](docs/minimal-starter.md) provides copyable
instructions, current work, and a handoff. It needs a file-capable agent and
manual review, with no installer or runtime registration.

The starter has not been established as the preferred default. Read the
[evidence and limits](docs/minimal-starter-evidence.md), then try the
[one-week comparison](docs/minimal-starter.md#evaluate-it-for-one-week).
Existing full-template users should keep their current workflow and evaluate
the starter in a separate project.

## Quick start

Try [your first reviewed handoff](docs/first-handoff.md) for a small Claude-to-Codex
example. Then inspect [source briefings and change history](docs/continuity.md).

Personal and business context often belongs in a private repository. Create an empty private repository first if that applies to you, and never commit credentials or a raw account export.

### Start from a published release

Source version 1.1.1 is a candidate until the immutable release is published;
[v1.0.0](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/agent-context-os/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
is the latest published release until then.

For a version-pinned workspace, open [v1.1.1](https://github.com/conorbronsdon/agent-context-os/releases/tag/v1.1.1)
and download all five attached assets: the template `.tar`, bundle lock,
provenance, `OFFLINE-VERIFY.md`, and `SHA256SUMS`. Follow that release's
`agent-context-os-template-v1.1.1.OFFLINE-VERIFY.md` to verify the assets before
extracting and running setup. GitHub's generated source ZIP and tar.gz are
repository snapshots; the attached template tar is the canonical workspace.
Use the [v1.1.1 release notes](docs/releases/v1.1.1.md) for what that version
ships. Changes and support promotions described on a development branch may
require a later release.

Initialize your own Git repository inside the verified extracted workspace
before running setup (`git init`). This gives its hooks and Git evidence an
independent boundary. The [first reviewed handoff](docs/first-handoff.md) covers
release verification and a local synthetic exercise.

Version 1.1.1 adds first-class Devin CLI support. If the 1.1.1 release is not
published yet, use v1.0.0 or the source setup path below; do not treat a
candidate branch as published artifact qualification.

### Start from source

Clone the source when you want the current branch and its development tools:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conorbronsdon/agent-context-os.git my-context
cd my-context

# Recommended for a private copy:
git remote rename origin upstream
git remote add origin <YOUR_PRIVATE_REPO_URL>

# Select every agent this repository will use:
bash scripts/setup.sh --agents claude,codex
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents hermes
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents openclaw
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents opencode
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents cursor
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents devin
# bash scripts/setup.sh --agents none  # core-only
```

Setup presents an exact, digest-bound proposal before recording the selected
set. Reruns add agents but never remove them; use the explicit lifecycle to
disable one later. Omit the option, or use `--agents auto`, for local
auto-detection without changing repository intent. The singular `--agent` form
is a deprecated singleton alias. See [workspace
configuration](docs/workspace-configuration.md) for the full contract.

After setup, `bash scripts/contextos.sh agent list` shows tracked activation and
local registration separately. `agent enable` (or `agent add`) creates an
additive proposal; `agent disable` creates the only proposal allowed to shrink
the set. Neither operation deletes bundled adapter files.

Then start your agent from the repository root. In the normal v0.12
full-template wrapper path, the product kernel, durable context, and nominal
active work share one root. A marker-only JSON workspace may use an already-loaded
executable package for discovery and reports, but a marker-only root cannot
apply content or configure runtimes until the trusted product closure is
materialized there. A containing Git worktree may supply read-only commit
evidence without gaining context mutation authority.

For a separate application repository, pass exact distinct roots and create a
reviewable attachment proposal (global role options precede the command):

```bash
bash /path/to/context-os/scripts/contextos.sh \
  --context-root /path/to/context-repo \
  --working-root /path/to/application \
  project attach --id my-app
```

Apply the returned digest with the same root options and `--runtime generic`.
Later start/setup/update/end invocations use those exact roots. Context OS writes
only ContextRoot; WorkingRoot contributes bounded Git identity, status, and
history evidence and receives no marker or lifecycle file. A moved application
requires a reviewed `project rebind --id my-app` proposal. See the [root
contract](docs/root-contract.md).

| Starting point | Next action |
|---|---|
| New workspace in Claude Code | Run `/setup` |
| New workspace in Codex | Run `$setup` |
| New workspace in Hermes | Follow the [Hermes adapter guide](adapters/hermes/README.md), then run `/context-setup` after exposing the repository skills |
| New workspace in OpenClaw | Follow the [OpenClaw adapter](adapters/openclaw/README.md), then run `/contextos <alias> setup` through an authorized operator surface |
| New workspace in OpenCode | Follow the [OpenCode adapter](adapters/opencode/README.md), then run `/context-setup` from the repository root |
| New workspace in Cursor | Follow the separate [CLI and experimental IDE paths](adapters/cursor/README.md), then run `/context-setup` |
| New workspace in Devin | Start Devin CLI from the repository root and run `/context-setup`; for a cloud session, complete the [managed-account checks](adapters/devin/README.md) and run `@skills:context-setup` |
| Existing context in another assistant | Follow the [migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md), then use the selected material during setup |
| claude.ai only | Use [SETUP-PROMPTS.md](SETUP-PROMPTS.md) and copy the approved output into the repository |

The setup interview fills the identity, first project, workflows, and weekly state files. It can start from your answers or from a migration packet you reviewed first. See the full [getting started guide](docs/getting-started.md) for prerequisites, privacy choices, and verification.

## See the loop

![A start session in Claude Code: state files load and a session briefing comes back, using sample data from the included example musician project](docs/assets/start-demo.gif)

`/start` in Claude Code, `/context-start` in Hermes, Cursor, Devin CLI, or OpenCode, `$start` in Codex,
`/contextos <alias> start` in OpenClaw, and `@skills:context-start` in a Devin session read your state,
priorities, decisions, blockers, and recent handoff. The result is grounded in
files rather than reconstructed from chat.

At the end, `/end` or `$end` proposes a handoff for review before it updates `sessions/` and `state/`. The namespaced `$context-end` form remains supported.

<sub>The GIF is scripted with sample data. [`docs/start-demo.tape`](docs/start-demo.tape) regenerates it, and [`docs/demo/start-session.sh`](docs/demo/start-session.sh) contains the transcript. Neither reads your state or calls a model.</sub>

## Daily workflow

Start small. Use the core loop for a week, add one active project, then turn a repeated task into a skill when the repetition is clear.

| Moment | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Hermes | OpenClaw | Cursor CLI / IDE (experimental) | Devin CLI / session (experimental) | Shared result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| First run or major refresh | `/setup` | `$setup` | `/context-setup` | `/context-setup` | `/contextos <alias> setup` | `/context-setup` | `/context-setup` / `@skills:context-setup` | Reviewed context proposal |
| Start work | `/start` | `$start` | `/context-start` | `/context-start` | `/contextos <alias> start` | `/context-start` | `/context-start` / `@skills:context-start` | Read-only continuity inventory and briefing |
| Save a checkpoint | `/update` | `$update` | `/context-update` | `/context-update` | `/contextos <alias> update` | `/context-update` | `/context-update` / `@skills:context-update` | Hash-checked update and receipt |
| Finish work | `/end` | `$end` | `/context-end` | `/context-end` | `/contextos <alias> end` | `/context-end` | `/context-end` / `@skills:context-end` | Hash-checked handoff, decisions, and receipt |

OpenClaw setup, update, and end can require multiple operator turns. Resume the
owned workflow with `/contextos <alias> continue <session-key> <response>`, then
apply the independently reviewed proposal from a trusted shell; the OpenClaw
plugin itself exposes no apply command.

The namespaced `$context-setup`, `$context-start`, `$context-update`, and
`$context-end` invocations remain available for compatibility.

Claude Code also ships host-specific commands for capture, daily checks, recovery, context search, and auto-memory curation. The [host boundary](docs/codex-onboarding.md#host-specific-boundaries) names what is portable and what is not.

## Bring existing context with you

Do not import an entire chat archive into active context. Use the [migration guide](docs/migration-guide.md) to:

1. select the assistant, project, or small set of conversations that contains useful context;
2. produce an inventory or compact migration packet;
3. classify each item as keep, verify, skip, or archive;
4. map approved facts, decisions, projects, and workflows into canonical files; and
5. validate the repository before committing.

The guide covers ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini Apps, Gemini CLI, and a generic path for other systems. Gemini CLI also has privacy-first `$migrate-gemini` and `$mine-gemini-workflows` skills for selected configuration and session evidence. Consumer Gemini CLI requests transitioned to Antigravity CLI in June 2026; continuing enterprise/API-key Gemini CLI and Antigravity are separate targets, and this repository does not claim Antigravity lifecycle or permission parity.

## Host support

<!-- runtime-support:start -->
| Host | Tier | Support |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | first-class | Shared lifecycle, slash-command adapters, hooks, optional live reads, and Claude-only auto-memory curation |
| Codex | first-class | Shared lifecycle, native skills, project instructions, hooks, and reviewed proposal/apply writes |
| Cursor | first-class | First-class Agent CLI lifecycle and handoff with exact-version evidence; IDE remains experimental, with no hook or native-memory bridge |
| Devin | first-class | First-class Devin CLI lifecycle and handoff with exact-version evidence and an import guard; cloud sessions remain experimental and Devin Review is instruction-only compatibility |
| Hermes Agent | first-class | First-class CLI lifecycle with explicit skill preloading, reviewed kernel apply, advisory hooks, and verified native-memory separation |
| OpenClaw | first-class | External-plugin multi-turn lifecycle with alias-bound lightweight subagents, copied portable skills, separate private memory, and trusted-shell kernel apply |
| OpenCode | first-class | Repository-native AGENTS.md and Agent Skills discovery with typed lifecycle commands, native permissions, and deterministic proposal/apply safety |
<!-- runtime-support:end -->

Compatibility paths that are not registered runtime adapters:

| Host | Compatibility path |
|---|---|
| Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI | Migration tooling plus portable-skill discovery for continuing enterprise/API-key Gemini CLI; no complete workspace adapter, and no Antigravity discovery or permission parity is claimed |
| claude.ai | Manual consumer of selected knowledge files; no repository writes, hooks, or slash-command parity |
| Other agents | Can use the Markdown state and portable skills only when their file and Agent Skills support is compatible |

## One source, explicit host adapters

| Capability | Shared | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Hermes | OpenClaw | Cursor CLI / IDE (experimental) | Devin CLI / session (experimental) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Identity, project, state, and session files | Yes | Reads | Reads | Reads | Reads | Reads | Reads | Reads |
| Deterministic proposal/apply and receipts | Yes | Adapter | Native skill calls | Typed command + native skill | Installed skill calls | Copied skill calls | Native skill calls | Native skill calls |
| Lifecycle vocabulary | Semantics | `/setup` etc. | `$setup` etc. | `/context-setup` etc. | `/context-setup` etc. | `/contextos <alias> setup` etc. | `/context-setup` etc. | `/context-setup` / `@skills:context-setup` etc. |
| Project hooks | Event contract only | `.claude/` | `.codex/` | Not claimed | Optional adapter | Not claimed | Not claimed | CLI `.devin/hooks.v1.json`; session not claimed |
| Native memory | No | Claude auto-memory | Outside contract | Outside contract | `MEMORY.md` / `USER.md` | Private workspace | Outside contract | Outside contract; cloud state account-managed |

The shared layer is intentionally plain files. Provider-specific tool names, hooks, permissions, and memory features stay in their adapter directories.

## Optional integrations

The [optional integrations catalog](references/integrations.md) and its
[machine-readable aggregate](integrations/catalog.json) are generated from
entry-local sources in [`integrations/entries/`](integrations/entries/). Each
entry declares supported hosts, credentials, reads, writes, publish or
destructive capabilities, confirmation gates, evidence, a health check, and
uninstall behavior.

Start with the task-based [integration chooser](docs/integrations-guide.md), add at most one new trust boundary at a time, then read the selected generated entry in full.

Maintainers can run `python3 scripts/integrations.py freshness` to see which
entries are approaching or past their human evidence-review date. Pass
`--as-of YYYY-MM-DD` when reproducible output is required.

The catalog spans portable skill collections, creator tools, CLIs, and MCP
servers. Treat the generated catalog and task-based chooser as the current
inventory rather than relying on a hand-maintained summary. `listed` and
`experimental` entries are leads, not endorsements. Setup never installs,
authenticates, or activates them.

```

The workspace migration command can now create a digest-bound proposal for
`contextos.workspace.json` and, when applicable, retire legacy `workspace.yaml`
in the same recoverable transaction. Setup-time agent selection remains tracked
in #65. The template does not ship a live root file because that would override
an existing clone's legacy YAML before its migration is reviewed.

Once present, `contextos.workspace.json` is the provider-neutral root marker,
including for a marker-only workspace. Existing `AGENTS.md` plus `state/` or
`workspace.yaml` roots remain discoverable. The nearest recognized root wins,
and discovery never climbs past a nested `.git` repository boundary; use
`--root` to choose an explicit discovery start when cwd is not the intended
starting point. Discovery may still ascend from that path to the nearest valid
root before a nested Git boundary.

Each fact should have one canonical home. `ROUTING.md` points an agent to the right file instead of copying the same context across prompts.

## Skills and memory

A skill is a Markdown workflow for a task you repeat. Provider-neutral skills belong in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Claude Code can add a thin adapter under `.claude/commands/`; Codex discovers the repository skill directly. [Build a first portable skill](docs/first-skill.md) after the core loop is working, or follow [the portable skill structure](projects/README.md) for a shared workflow.

Claude Code auto-memory is a separate, host-specific layer. The repository includes a typed [auto-memory specification](docs/auto-memory.md) and the [`/dream` curator](docs/dream-architecture.md), which creates proposals before anything writes back. Shared continuity still belongs in `state/` and `sessions/` so another supported agent can use it.

## Safety and validation

- Review generated context before writing or committing it.
- Keep raw exports, credentials, private reasoning, and migration scratch data outside tracked files.
- Treat integrations as disabled until you choose and configure one.
- Use one git worktree per concurrent agent session.
- Follow [`docs/safety-contract.md`](docs/safety-contract.md) before external writes, destructive actions, or permission changes.

Run the full local check after changing instructions, skills, scripts, adapters,
generated references, or tracked personal context:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-all.sh --workspace
```

The workspace mode permits new tracked files only below the component catalog's
declared extensible roots. CI and product contributors run the strict form
without `--workspace`, so every tracked template file still requires an owner.
Both forms check structure, adapter mappings, links, shell syntax, hook behavior,
JSON, tests, and generated integration documentation. They cannot prove the
behavior of an installed agent version or an external service.
