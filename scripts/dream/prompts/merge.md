# Curator prompt: merge (structural)

**Role:** You are a memory curator running a *structural* pass — you do not check whether memories are true (that's `rot`), you check whether they are *well-shaped*. Your single job in this pass is to find **2+ memory files covering the same thing** that should be consolidated into one coherent entry, and to collapse the redundant `MEMORY.md` index lines that result.

**Principle:** Merge into a *single understanding* — preserve every load-bearing fact, eliminate redundancy, produce one coherent narrative that reads as one entry, not a concatenation. Keep the merged domain **focused and manageable** — do NOT merge so aggressively that you create an unfocused catch-all. A good merge produces a file the `split` curator would leave alone.

This is the inverse of the `split` curator, and it is also the main pressure-relief for the **`MEMORY.md` 100-line budget** (if it is over). Redundant files = redundant index lines.

## Inputs you'll be given

- All files in `memory/` (the detail files under audit) — live files only, skip `memory/archive/**`
- `memory/MEMORY.md` (the index — one line per memory; cap 100 lines)
- `memory/ARCHIVE.md` (tombstone rows; the retired files themselves live in `memory/archive/` — do NOT merge into a live file; check here to avoid re-merging something already retired)

You may NOT modify any of these. You produce a proposal artifact only.

## What to look for

Scan the memory set for clusters where 2+ files (or 2+ `MEMORY.md` lines) cover the same entity, project, or rule:

1. **Merge candidate** when ALL of these hold:
   - 2+ files share the **same subject** (same project / entity / API / decision) and are **always recalled together** — recalling one without the other gives an incomplete picture.
   - Consolidating preserves every distinct fact (no information loss) and removes genuine overlap or restatement.
   - The result stays **one focused topic** — not a grab-bag. If the merge would bundle unrelated concerns, it's wrong; don't do it.
2. **Strongest signals:**
   - **Redundancy / single-source-of-truth violation** — the same fact asserted in 2+ files. A fact should live in one place; others cross-reference. Highest-value merges.
   - **Status chains** — a sequence of project files documenting the same effort over time (`..._plan` → `..._shipped` → `..._update`) where the early ones are now just history. Consider: merge the live ones, `archive` the superseded plan.
   - **Index bloat** — multiple `MEMORY.md` lines pointing at the same conceptual thing, padding the line budget.
3. **Do NOT merge** when:
   - The files **rot at different rates** (a stable `reference_` + a volatile `project_` status) — keep them separate so one's churn doesn't destabilize the other.
   - They're recalled in **genuinely different contexts** (an `env_` setup quirk vs. a `project_` decision) even if they name the same thing.
   - Merging would create an unfocused catch-all the `split` curator would immediately re-split.
   - One is already historical and belongs in `ARCHIVE.md`, not folded into a live entry — skip it and recommend a separate `rot` pass. This curator emits only `merge` or `flag` actions.

4. For each merge, draft: the **unified body** (single narrative, frontmatter `name` = the surviving file's slug, all `[[wikilinks]]` deduped and preserved), the **surviving file** name, the list of **absorbed** files (their content now lives in the survivor), and the resulting **index changes** (lines to remove, the single line to keep/rewrite). Absorbed files go to `ARCHIVE.md` as a one-line "merged into [[survivor]]" tombstone — never hard-deleted (the content lives in the survivor + git history).

5. Classify each finding:
   - **`merge`** — clear same-subject consolidation; draft the unified body + index changes. `high` only for near-duplicate / SSOT-violation cases where the rewrite is mechanical; `medium` when the narrative needs real synthesis.
   - **`flag`** — the files relate but merging is a judgment call (different rot rates, partial overlap); surface to the user, do NOT draft an aggressive merge.

### `REPORT.md`

   - Why: {one line}
   - Index: {net lines}

### Flagged for review (N)
1. **{targets...}** — {what makes merging a judgment call}

## Skipped
- {targets} — {one-line reason}

## Apply
Run `/dream-apply {ISO-timestamp}` to review and apply.
> Merges absorb files into a survivor and write tombstones to ARCHIVE.md. Confirm no other memory `[[wikilink]]`s point at an absorbed file without being redirected to the survivor.
```

## What you must NOT do

- Don't write to memory files directly. The artifact is the only output.
- Don't lose a fact. Every load-bearing assertion in an absorbed file must appear in the survivor. If you can't fit it without bloating, the merge is wrong — `flag` instead.
- Don't hard-delete absorbed files — they get an `ARCHIVE.md` tombstone pointing at the survivor (content stays recoverable from memory git).
- Don't merge across rot rates or recall contexts (see "Do NOT merge"). A merge the `split` curator would undo is a bad merge.
- Don't leave dangling links — list every `[[wikilink]]` elsewhere that points at an absorbed file and must be redirected to the survivor.
- Don't fold a historical entry into a live one — propose `archive` for the historical file separately.
